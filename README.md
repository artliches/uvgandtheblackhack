## Everyone is unique/No one is unique
Every player at the table takes turns roll 3d6 and adding the numbers together to form the stat spread:
* **S**trength: physical power, melee attacks and melee defense
* **E**ndurance: resiliance and physical well-being
* **A**gility: swiftness, ranged attacks and ranged defenses
* **C**harisma: divine favor, fortune, and luck
* **A**ura: mental and spiritual resiliance, divine spell power
* **T**hought: mental aptitude and cognition, arcane spell power

If any of the generated numbers are 14+, the next number is automatically a 7. The players when continue to roll the rest of the numbers normally.

Once all six of the numbers are generated and the stat array is filled, the players can then individually swap any two of the numbers.

## A Healthy Start
All characters start level one with 10 Life. Life growth afterwards is decided based on your class choice.

## Blood Magic & Biocorruption
Casting magic of any kind requires the caster to pay a price in Life.

The cost of a spell is equal to double the spell's level (**cost = spellLevel * 2**).
Casting class (such as wizards and witches) make spell cheaper by making them equal the spell level (**cost = spellLevel**). They can also memorize spells, removing them from their inventory and reducing the cost to 0, at the price of 1 permanent Life.

A caster can only memorize a number of spells equal to the number of their **HD**, and of spell levels equal to their **HD**, so a caster with 2 **HD** can memorize two spells, of levels 1 or 2.

Any time a character cast a spell, they risk biocorruption. Once the spell is resolved, the character must test the relevant spell casting attribute, usually Aura or Thought. If they fail the test, then they recieve some biocorruption (UVG pg **TODO**).

If they cast the spell more than once per session, then they have disadvantage on this test.

## Creating the Canon
Exploring the UVG is about discovering things. To keep with that spirit, whenever a player/character comes across something new or declares something new about the world (such as seeing a new animal or landmark, or talking about their god), every player must create one rumor about the subject.

Once everyone has stated one rumor about the subject, the players can then soft veto any one rumor, allowing the player who was veto'd to create a new rumor. The guide can also veto any or all of the rumors.

Players can veto once per session, the guide can veto any number of times (**within reason, don't be a jerk**).

Once all the rumors are agreed upon, the guide will create a rumor card of that subject and add it to the rumor deck. **Players should make sure to pester the guide about this if they fail to do so.**
